Livesplit autosplitter scripts writtin by me (GMP)

# Features:
## Raji: An Ancient Epic
- Auto splitting (Start is not supported as of now. Tip: Use the same key as start hotkey in livesplit and for starting the game in the title screen)
- Categories supported - Any% NMG and All Orbs NMG (Other categories and more splits coming soon in the future)
 
## DOSBox-X 0.83.8
- In Game Timier (IGT)
- Timer must be started manually (preferably after launching the game)
- The sole purpose of this script to be able to time strats in dosbox-x (as it has savestates) in IGT

If you encounter a bug or want to have a custom split added, you can contact me in discord: G M P#0177
